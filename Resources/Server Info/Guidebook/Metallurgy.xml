# Metallurgy
Raw, unprocessed ore must be processed and refined before it can be used on the station or sold for premium prices.

## Obtaining Ore
You can obtain ore by mining it from the asteroid. To identify ores, use the ore analyzer.

## Using the Furnace
The furnace is the most primitive way to process ores. It uses electrical power to melt ores, after which they can be tapped and poured into sheets.

1. Sort and portion your raw material for producing the product you desire (see Furnace Recipes below). As a general rule, more pure materials are worth more.

2. Open the furnace door and load your raw material.

3. Close the door and turn on the furnace.

4. Using an infrared thermometer, monitor the temperature until the furnace reaches the minimum recipe temperature. Do not allow the furnace temperature to exceed 1500Â°C, or irreversible damage may occur.
